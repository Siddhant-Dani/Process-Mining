This folder contains working code for ICPM 2023 contest. The code is divided in two sections, training and testing. Training code contains the CNN model architectures used for discovering process models. While the testing code contains prediction using discovered models and classification of traces using RandomForestClassifier.

To get it working on any machine only changes needed are directory paths for datasets and paths for storing the models.
